## Our Cats

We have 2 cats, and they are both over 10 years old.

We think both cats are [American shorthairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Shorthair) but we haven't tried to DNA test or check.

[Here is more information](https://www.purina.com/cats/cat-breeds/american-shorthair) about American shorthair cats.
